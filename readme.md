# Packing Slips #

This applicaiton is for the creation and storing of Packing Slips to return equipment that is broken or otherwise in need of repair. After creation the slip can be printed, edited, or deleted. 

You can save vendors to quickly populate the fields in the form. You can also attach as many items to a packing slip as you like.

I created it with our devices in mind, but you could alter the requirements of the forms for a variety of uses.
